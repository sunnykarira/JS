How is JS code executed?

JS code is hosted in some environment i.e. mostly a browser (chrome, safari etc.). 
Other hosts like nodejs apps.
We will focus on the browser.


Our code: 
Host -> JS Engine (Host takes code and executes it)
Engine - chromeV8, Spidermonkey



Inside Engine:
Code is parsed by parser. Seeks syntax of code is correct.
Then parser produces a Abstract Syntax Tree.
Then it gets converted into Machine Code.
Then code runs.
