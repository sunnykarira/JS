// Lesson 73

Event Delegation

Event Bubbling: When an event is fired on some element in DOM than the exact same event 
is triggered on all of the parent elements one at a time. (Event bubbles up in the DOM tree)

Target Element: The element on which on the starting, event is fired. Imp is this
target element is stored as a property in Event object.

Event Delegation: If event is fired in the DOM tree then what we can do is put an
event listener on a parent and wait for the event to bubble up and then can do what we want to do.

USE CASES FOR EVENT DELEGATION

1. When we have an element with lots of child element we are interested in.
2. When we want an event handler attached to an element that is not yet in the DOM
when our page is loaded.
